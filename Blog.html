  <h2>On my way to buy a touring bicycle</h2>
  <p>I got this new hobby after the biking trip to Tien Giang with my friend. The trip was great and I found out that I simply enjoyed the mere experience of cycling.</p>
  It gives me a peace of mind moment and makes me realize the beauty around. On the road. During the sunset. Or simply through a rice field.
  <p>I stopped thinking about death for a while...</p>
  I bought a new cycling helmet just this noon. It is a high quality one (of this producer) and I hope I won't lose it, unlike my motorbike helmet recently.
  <br>
  We bought couple helmets twice and always lost one of each pair. Heartbroken, isn't it? Part of me thinks it's destiny. The other thinks it's bullshit belief! Haha.
  <br>
  I believe in the latter.

  <p><em>Have faith.</em></p>
  The bicycle options I'm considering are:
  <p><table>
    <thead>
      <th>Bike name</th>
      <th>Best price</th>
      <th>Thoughts</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Galaxy LP300</td>
        <td>4.3M VND</td>
        <td>Good one. Well known brand</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Fornix FR303</td>
        <td>3.1M VND</td>
        <td>Affordable option that meets basic needs. Good peace of mind</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table></p>
  <em>Update 2021-04-16: bought a Vinabike Escape-V at 4.7M. Despite the weird brand that I didn't like at first, this is a very good price compared to the quality.</em>

  <h2>Now I will take care of myself better</h2>
  <p>I know I've been very bad with self-care especially since I was in the best relationship of my life. She was lovely, lively and ... lovely. I could be all day by her side. We would make jokes, all the weird ones, laugh at stupid thoughts and enjoy little things in our lives.</p>
  <p><em>But now she's away.</em></p>
  <p>I should stop thinking about her. Time to be alive again. Renew myself. Find a new goal. Achieve it. Impress myself instead of somebody else.</p>
  <p>Because there are still a lot to learn. And you can't while all you do is giving yourself excuses.</p>
